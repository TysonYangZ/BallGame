# BallGame

Title: 
Super Ball

Description of Game:
You play as a ball on a floating island with ramps and cubes you can interact with. Move around the environment trying to get as many blue cubes as possible before the timer ends in order to get the highest score.

Controls: 
Move around - W,A,S,D

How to Play:
- Blue cubes and enemies spawn in random locations.
- Get as many blue cubes as you can before the timer runs out. Blue cubes increase your score and you have two minutes to collect as many as possible. 
- Use the environment to your advantage in order to reach places faster. Ramps can be used to jump over gaps and reach new areas. Learning how to use them will allow you move much more quickly around the map, which will allow you to collect blue cubes faster.
- Avoid enemy projectiles. Running into them will kill you ending the game. Running into enemys will kill them instead. 
- More enemies and blue cubes spawn as soon as you touch a blue cube.
- Be careful! Focusing only on blue cubes and not killing enemies may result in it being more difficult to move around the map later into the game.

Have Fun!
